# FunGames

This repository contains a collection of small browser games. A new server and
multiplayer version of Tic Tac Toe were added to allow two players to compete
online.

## Running the server

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Start the server using `npm start`.
3. Open `http://localhost:3000/tic-tac-toe-online.html` in two browsers to play
   against another person.
